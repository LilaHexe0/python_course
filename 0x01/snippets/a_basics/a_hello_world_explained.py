"""
Summary

import
  - The 'platform' module is loaded. 
  - A lot of functionality comes in libraries, i.e. modules. In Python this is 
    called 'batteries included'. We will see more snippets about 'import' later.

print
  - Output function with string literal and prefix 'f'. 
  - This allows for expressions to be enclosed in a {}. This type of formatting is 
    also known as 'string interpolation' (or 'variable interpolation', 
    'variable substitution' or 'variable expansion').
    
Execution
  - Code is executed from top to bottom.
