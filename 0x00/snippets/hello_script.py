Summary

Shebang or Hash-Bang
  - This makes it possible to execute the file directly as a script that 
    implicitly invokes the interpreter. This still requires permission to 
    execute, e.g. via 
        > chmod +x hello_script.py
    Use 
        > chmod -x hello_script.py
    to remove the execution flag again. 
  - Note:
      * It is not '!/usr/bin/python' but '!/usr/bin/env python'.
        to take virtual environments into account.
      * The shebang is not necessary for the script to work.
      * This specification is only for the *nix faction and we will 
        rarely run the script from the command line as executable.

Encoding
  - For Python 3.x UTF-8 is the default.
