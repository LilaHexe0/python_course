# Python Course ‚Äì Welcome

Good to have you here! üëç 

To get started, you should first clone this project and read the docs in this order:
- [Background](./docs/python_background.pdf)
- [Setup](./docs/python_setup.pdf)
- [IDE](./docs/python_ide.pdf)
- [Units](./docs/python_units.pdf)

Your first goal should be to have the Python ecosystem in place and a working Python installation at the end. After that, you can start following the README in the units.
