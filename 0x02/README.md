# Unit `0x02`


## Topics covered

- Primitives
- Collections
- Control-flow
- Function calling

---

### Primitives

- The topic of this folder is 'primitives', like in other languages, so here `int`, `bool`, `float` and `string`. We have omitted some standard types here and will deal with them later, e.g. `complex` or special types such as `NoneType`. 
- Actually there are no 'primitives' in Python, only objects. You can see this by looking at the definition in builtins.py, e.g. via the 'PyCharm' context menu on `int`, then 'Go To Declaration'. 
- `int` and `float` are so-called 'numeric types'.
- Primitive types are immutable. This means that once a variable of a primitive type is assigned a value, the value itself cannot be changed. Instead, operations result in new objects being created.

---

### Collections

- Standard 'collections' are: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `frozenset`, `range`. In fact, `range` does not __contain__ all the numbers but behaves like a read-only-collection. We have omitted some standard types here and will deal with them later, e.g. binary types such as `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `memoryview`.
- Some of the containers are mutable, others are not. For each container or collection, we first consider the operations that do not modify the data (e.g. read, find, contains, traverse, construction) and then the operations that modify the data (e.g. write, add/insert, delete). So, these are the operations that should always be on a cheat sheet if you are making one:
  - access or search a specific element (all cases)
  - add and remove an element (if mutable)

---

### Control-Flow

- In fact, nothing new here, just the well-known `if`, `while`, `for` and exceptions.
- Pattern matching from Python 3.10 is discussed in a future unit.

---

### Function calling

- We focus on function calling with named and default parameters. 
- `args` and `kwargs` are covered later.


## Tasks

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Self-Study'

- Review all snippets from the lecture. Ask if there are any outstanding questions.
- Run and understand all content from scripts that start with `self_`. Ask if you miss an idea.

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Recap'

- Review any outstanding tasks from previous units. Is there any task that you should definitely do or have questions about?

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Wild Vine'

You are given a weighted, undirected graph. It is represented as a dictionary where the keys are node numbers, and the values are dictionaries. These nested dictionaries denote the neighbors of the given node and the weight of the edges that connect the node to its neighbors.

Graph Representation

```
GRAPH = {
    1: {2: 5, 3: 1},
    2: {1: 5, 3: 3},
    3: {1: 1, 2: 3, 4: 2},
    4: {3: 2}
}
```

- Node `1` connects to node `2` with weight `5` and node `3` with weight `1`.
- Node `2` connects back to node `1` (weight `5`) and node `3` (weight `3`).
- Node `3` connects to nodes `1`, `2`, and `4` with weights `1`, `3`, and `2`, respectively, and so on.

Task

- Write a function `find_min_weight_neighbor` working on `GRAPH` to find the neighbor of a given node with the lowest edge weight in the graph. If there are multiple neighbors with the same lowest weight, return any one of them.
  - For start node `3`, the solver would look for node `3`'s neighbors `{1: 1, 2: 3, 4: 2}` and return the minimum weight neighbor `(1, 1)` (neighbor = `1`, weight = `1`).

- Print the result for all nodes in `GRAPH`.

- Bonus: Write a function to calculate the shortest path from a given starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

- Compare your solution with `wild_vine_one_solution.py` in `solutions`. 
  - Is your solution correct and complete? 
  - Do you have any ideas on how to improve your solution?
  - Is there a detail where your solution is better or different? Tell us.

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'Belle Zinnia'

Student's data is given by (grade 100.0 is best, below 40.0 fail)
```
MATH = "Math"
ENGLISH = "English"
PHYSICS = "Physics"

SUBJECTS = [MATH, ENGLISH, PHYSICS]

GRADES = {
    "Alice": {MATH: 85, ENGLISH: 78, PHYSICS: 92},
    "Bob": {MATH: 56, ENGLISH: 33, PHYSICS: 52},
    "Charlie": {MATH: 97, ENGLISH: 88, PHYSICS: 91},
    "Diana": {MATH: 42, ENGLISH: 30, PHYSICS: 36},
    "Eve": {MATH: 67, ENGLISH: 80, PHYSICS: 45},
}
```

The main solver looks like this

```
def solve():
    average_grades = calc_average_grades()
    print(f" 1| {average_grades=}")

    top_student, highest_average = determine_top_performer(average_grades)
    print(f" 2| {top_student=} with {highest_average:.2f}")

    students_below_40 = determine_all_students_with_a_fail()
    print(f" 3| {students_below_40=}")

    passed_subjects = determine_subjects_everyone_passed()
    print(f" 4| {passed_subjects=}")

    student_names_sorted = sort_students_by_average_grade(average_grades)
    print(f" 5| {student_names_sorted=}")

```

You are tasked with analyzing student performance data stored in the dictionary `GRADES`. Each student has scores across different subjects. 

> Each task should be solved in two ways: First, use only basic Python constructs such as loops, conditionals, and basic list/dictionary operations. Second, if you like, follow the hint (see Python docs) and solve it in a shorter way. If it does not work - no problem. We will come back to this particular approach in future lectures.

- `calc_average_grades`: Compute the average grade for each student and store these averages in a separate dictionary.
  - Result: `{'Alice': 85.0, 'Bob': 47.0, 'Charlie': 92.0, 'Diana': 36.0, 'Eve': 64.0}`
  - Hint: Use a 'dictionary comprehension', `sum` and `len`.

- `determine_top_performer`: Determine the name of the student with the highest average grade and the value of that average.
  - Result: `'Charlie', 92.00`
  - Hint: Use `max` with a `key` using `average_grades`.

- `determine_all_students_with_a_fail`: Identify all students who scored below 40 in at least one subject.
  - Result: `['Bob', 'Diana']`
  - Hint: Use a 'conditional list comprehension' and `any`.
- `determine_subjects_everyone_passed`: Find all the subjects in which every student scored at least 40.
  - Result: `['Math']`
  - Hint: Use a 'conditional dictionary comprehension' and `all`. 

- `sort_students_by_average_grade`: Produce a list of student names sorted by their average grades in descending order. Do not use predefined sorting functions in the basic version.
  - Result: `['Charlie', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'Bob', 'Diana']`
  - Hint: Use `sorted` on `average_grades` with a clever `key` and a 'list comprehension' to extract only the students.

- Compare your solution with `bella_zinnia_one_solution.py` in `solutions`. 
  - Is your solution correct and complete? 
  - Do you have any ideas on how to improve your solution?
  - Is there a detail where your solution is better or different? Tell us.
