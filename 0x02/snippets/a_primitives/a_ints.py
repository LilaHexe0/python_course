"""
This snippet discusses integers and object equality.

Teaching focus
  - The 'using_ints' function is discussed in detail, as its structure is
    a template for the others.
  - A notable feature is the discussion of equality in 'what_means_equal'.
  - It is interesting to look at the internal representation of integers
    in the next snippet.

Summary

Topics
  - ints
  - value and identity equality

Ints
  - Ints can be of any length, i.e. exact.
  - The memory requirement depends on the length, so short ints require less memory.

Value Equality (`==`):
  - checks if two objects have the same value;
  - for most built-in types, Python uses type-specific `__eq__` methods to implement value comparison;
  - two different objects in memory may still be equal in terms of value.

Identity Equality (`is`):
  - checks if two objects are the exact same instance, i.e., identical in memory;
  - `is` evaluates to `True` only if two variables reference the same object.
