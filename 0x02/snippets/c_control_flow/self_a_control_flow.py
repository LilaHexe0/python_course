Summary

Topics
  - if
  - while, break, continue
  - for
  - list comprehension
  - exceptions
  - else in try

'else' in Exception:
  - From JetBrains: The else clause is useful in cases where you want to run 
    some code if the try block is successful and no exceptions occur, but you 
    want this code to be separate from the try block to make clear that it 
    isn't expected to throw exceptions. This can help improve the readability 
    of your code.
