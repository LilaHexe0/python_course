This snippet discusses tuples and tuple operations.

Teaching focus
  - This topic is part of the self-study during the exercises or at home.
  - The tuple operations are similar to those of an immutable list.

Summary

Topics
  - tuples
  - non-modifying operations

Tuple
  - Can contain data of different type.
  - Immutable.
  - Suitable data types for grouping multiple values where neither the 
    content nor the number changes, for example in the case of return values.
