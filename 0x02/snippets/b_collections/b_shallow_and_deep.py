Summary

Topics
  - shallow and deep copy

Copy
  - A shallow copy creates a new object but does not copy the objects within it. 
    Instead, it only copies references to those objects.
  - If the elements are mutable, changes to them will be reflected across both 
    the original and the copy.
  - A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects contained 
    within it. This means the new object is completely independent of the original, 
    even if the objects inside are mutable.
